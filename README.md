# 108PSY App
  
  108PSY - is an MVP-type mobile app for the "Zhas Hackathon" which was held in Kazakhstan. This is just a technical solution for companies, the essence is that it is an application of tasks, where the user creates a task and tracks their performance, as well as was added a method "Ladder" from the request of companies.

The menu mainly shows user statistics, such as their efficiency, completed tasks, or active tasks. And so the tasks were divided into categories such as work, personal growth, health, etc.

* Create Task

Thanks to the prescribed functions this page is fully operational, the user writes the name of the task, then its category, and then a full description. Everything is simple and ingenious, and the program itself distributes a list of tasks.

* All Tasks

After setting tasks, the user can see which tasks have been created, which are active and which are completed, this was done for the convenience of the user. For example, in the screenshots everything is shown and clear.

* Support

In the support page most of the prescribed code and design for the method of "Stairs", which I mentioned above, it was done for companies, it works simply, going to this page the user keeps his statistics and the program itself shows what his result, obviously if the result is bad it offers to click to go to information about the method from companies, mostly done for monetization.
